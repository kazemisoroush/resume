            I am a passionate software engineer and lead with a keen eye for quality.
            I believe in code as a craft but appreciate that code doesn’t exist in a vacuum.
            I love delivering product features that customers want, improving business processes and making internal users’ lives easier.
            I enjoy practicing TDD and pair programming and will always advocate for agility.
